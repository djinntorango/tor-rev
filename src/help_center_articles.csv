24639678250771,Dark Mode Images,"<p>In recent years, dark mode has become a popular feature in applications and websites, offering users a visually comfortable and energy-efficient alternative. However, the transition to dark mode can present challenges for the visual elements, especially images. Let's explore why accommodating dark mode might necessitate different images and how this adaptation can enhance the overall user experience.</p>
<h2 id=""h_01HJWDVESTSERYQECE2N1XAR9Z"">Contrast Considerations</h2>
<p>Dark mode often involves a dark background, and images designed for a light background may not provide the necessary contrast. To maintain visibility and clarity, images intended for dark mode may require adjustments in terms of brightness, contrast, or even color palettes to ensure they stand out effectively against the darker backdrop.</p>
<h2 id=""h_01HJWDVC3M0G46117EJXZMH14B"">Reducing Eye Strain</h2>
<p>One of the primary reasons users opt for dark mode is to reduce eye strain, especially in low-light conditions. Images with high contrast or overly bright elements can be harsh on the eyes in dark mode. Adapting images for dark mode involves creating versions with softer contrasts and more subdued tones to promote a comfortable viewing experience.</p>
<h2 id=""h_01HJWDV9FMXZX0R3WZB54D1ZK9"">Color Harmony</h2>
<p>Colors can appear differently in dark mode due to the change in background brightness. Images optimized for dark mode may need a recalibration of their color schemes to maintain visual harmony. This ensures that the images integrate seamlessly with the overall aesthetics of the dark mode interface and avoid appearing too vibrant or jarring.</p>
<h2 id=""h_01HJWDV73X5JG9SDCH5KH4K8DG"">Maintaining Brand Consistency</h2>
<p>For applications and websites that employ dark mode, maintaining brand consistency is crucial. Images are integral to brand identity, and having versions tailored for both light and dark modes helps ensure a cohesive brand experience across various user preferences. This consideration is particularly important for logos, icons, and other key visual elements.</p>

20825175176851,How can agents leverage knowledge to help customers?,"<p>You can use our <a href=""https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012706488"" target=""_blank"">Knowledge Capture app</a> to leverage your team’s collective knowledge.</p>
<p>Using the app, agents can:
</p><ul>
  <li>Search the Help Center without leaving the ticket</li>
  <li>Insert links to relevant Help Center articles in ticket comments</li>
  <li>Add inline feedback to existing articles that need updates</li>
  <li>Create new articles while answering tickets using a pre-defined template</li>
</ul>


<p>Agents never have to leave the ticket interface to share, flag, or create knowledge, so they can help the customer, while also improving your self-service offerings for other customers.</p>

<p>To get started, see our <a href=""https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001975088"" target=""_blank"">Knowledge Capture documentation</a>.</p>

<p>And before your agents can start creating new knowledge directly from tickets, you’ll need to <a href=""https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002374987"" target=""_blank"">create a template</a> for them to use. To help you along, we’ve provided some template ideas below. You can copy and paste any sample template below into a new article, add the <strong>KCTemplate</strong> label to the article, and you’ll be all set.</p>
